# Iterators

# Calling the iter function on an iterable will create an iterator over that iterable. Each iterator keeps track of its position within the iterable. Calling the next function on an iterator will give the current value in the iterable and move the iterator's position to the next value.
# The relationship between an iterable and an iterator is analogous to the relationship between a book and a bookmark - an iterable contains the data that is being iterated over, and an iterator keeps track of your position within that data.
# Once an iterator has returned all the values in an iterable, subsequent calls to next on that iterable will result in a StopIteration exception. In order to be able to access the values in the iterable a second time, you would have to create a second iterator.
# Most iterators are alse iterables - that is, calling iter on them will return an iterator. This means that we can use them inside for loops. However, calling iter on most iterators will not create a new iterator - instead, it will simply return the same iterator.

# Generators

# When a generator function(including a yield statement) is called, it returns a generator object, which is a type of iterator(has a next method). A generator function is a special kind of Python function that uses a yield statement instead of a return statement to report values.
# The yield statement is similar to a return statement. However, while a return statement closes the current frame after the function exits, a yield statement causes the frame to be saved until the next time next is called, which allows the generator to automatically keep track of the iteration state.
# Once next is called again, execution resumes where it last stopped and continues until the next yield statement or the end of the function. A generator function can have multiple yield statements.
# When yield from is called on an iterator, it will yield every value from that iterator.
