# 1. A variable declared nonlocal must be defined in a parent frame which is not the global frame
# 2. Names in the current frame cannot be overridden using the nonlocal keyword.

# num_global = 10

#     nonlocal num_global # no binding for nonlocal 'num_global' found
#     num_global = num_global + 1 # local variable 'num_global' referenced before assignment
